# Refactoring to a reactive component setup

In this tutorial we will learn how to refactor a component written in imperative style to a fully reactive implementation.

To setup the project locally run following steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular.git rx-angular`
- `cd rx-angular`
- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm run nx serve state-demo` or `yarn nx serve state-demo`

The source can be found under `apps/state-demo/src/app/examples/demo-basics`

Chapters we will discuss are:

- [Setup a reactive state, selections and, UI interactions](./1/Readme.md)
- [Handing Side Effects reactively](./2/Readme.md)
